# **Sean Dumont**

## **About Me**

I am a **Computer Science student at the University of Rhode Island (Class of 2027)** focused on **AI/ML, data analytics, cybersecurity, and systems programming**. I specialize in building secure, efficient, and scalable tools that address real-world challenges, with a strong emphasis on automation, optimization, and practical implementation.

## **Technical Skills**

* **Programming:** C++, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS
* **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL
* **AI & Automation:** AI-powered tools, distributed computing, workflow optimization
* **Cybersecurity:** AI-assisted security systems, secure access control
* **Data Analytics:** Data processing, cleaning, and visualization
* **Tools & Platforms:** GitHub, MySQL Workbench, Linux Terminal, Unreal Engine (learning)

## **Current Project**

* **Distributed Compute Network (DCN)** â€“ A decentralized computing platform that distributes heavy computation tasks (AI workflows, data processing, large-scale simulations) across a network of everyday users. DCN focuses on secure task dispatch, resource sharing, and participant rewards while reducing computation costs and increasing processing efficiency.

## **2025 Learning Objectives**

* Master **SQL** and database optimization
* Complete **NeetCode 150** for data structures and algorithms
* Advance AI and cybersecurity integration in distributed systems
* Improve command-line efficiency and Git/GitHub workflows
